                <h3>Recipe-</h3>
                <br>1.Mutton Korma is a delectable mutton preparation, which can be prepared at home using some easily
                available ingredients in your kitchen. Here’s how you can prepare this delectable delicacy. Wash and
                drain the mutton pieces under cold running water. Now add mutton pieces to a deep pan with 1/2 to 1 cup
                of water and little salt. Bring to boil and reduce the flame.
                <br><br>
                2.Simmer until the meat is 60% cooked and once it is done, turn off the flame. Take a pan and dry roast
                all the ingredients for few minutes. Transfer the roasted masalas to a mixer grinder and grind to a fine
                paste. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium flame. Add the ground masala paste and stir-fry with
                a little water. Add the cooked mutton pieces in the pan and stir-fry until well coated. Add salt and mix
                well. Now add the curd and water.
                <br><br>
                3.Reduce flame and cover the pan with a lid. If you want to make it more spicy then add some black pepper
                powder this will accentuate the taste and will add a nice dark tint to the dish. Allow the dish to
                simmer for 30 to 45 minutes or until the meat is tender. Turn off the heat and transfer the mutton
                recipe to a serving dish. Garnish the mutton korma recipe with ginger, coriander leaves and lime juice.
                Serve hot with naan or rice.
                <br><br>
                4.To reduce the cooking time, you can parboil the mutton and then use it for the korma. Apart from that,
                if you want to give this dish a much rich taste and aroma, you can dry roast the spices and add it to
                the gravy. Moreover, to accentuate the taste of the dish replace the regular oil with ghee.
