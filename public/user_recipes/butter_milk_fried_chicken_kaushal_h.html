            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <br>DREDGE :
            <br>0.6 tbsp salt
            <br>0.5 tbsp thyme
            <br>0.5 tbsp basil
            <br>0.3 tbsp oregano
            <br>1 tbsp celery salt
            <br>1 tbsp black pepper
            <br>1 tbsp dried mustard
            <br>4 tbsp of red chilli powder
            <br>1 tbsp onion and garlic powder each
            <br>A pinch of MSG
            <br>2.5 cups of flour

            <br>MEAT :
            <br>800 - 1000 gms of chicken, skin on(as per preference)

            <br>MARINADE :
            <br>5 cups buttermilk (thick)
            <br>2 tbsp salt
            <br>1 tbsp oregano, onion, garlic, pepper, red chilli powder each.


            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Recipe-</h3>

            <br>1) Prepare the marinade, by mixing all the ingredients under the section of "MARINADE"(obviously lol
            xD). Give it a thorough mix and add the chicken. Allow it to rest in the marinade for at least 2
            hours.
            WHAT THIS DOES IS, IT SOFTENS AND TENDERIZES THE MEAT.
            <br><br>2) Prepare the dredge by combining all the ingredients under the section "DREDGE" (again, obviously
            lol xD). DO NOT PANIC IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE EXOTIC INGREDIENTS MENTIONED FOR THE DREDGE. USE
            WHATEVER SEASONING YOU LIKE FOR YOUR OUTER COATING OF THE FRIED CHICKEN. That works too :)
            <br><br>3) FRYING :
            This step is the most important of all. After resting your meat for at least 2 hours, take it out and shake
            off the excess buttermilk. Now, add 1 - 2 tbsp of the buttermilk marinade to the flour mixture(dredge) to
            form little clumps of flour. THIS MAKES THE CHICKEN EVEN MORE CRISPIER AND GIVES IT LITTLE CRISPY BALL LIKE
            TEXTURE. Now, add in the marinated chicken to the dredge and set aside for 10 minutes. AGAIN, TO MAKE IT
            EVEN MORE CRISPY.
            Get your oil nice and hot. add in the white meat first because it takes longer to cook. WHITE MEAT = BREAST
            MEAT.
            Fry this for around 4 - 5 minutes, and then add in the dark meat. DARK MEAT = WINGS, LEGS, THIGHS.
            Fry on one side for around 5 - 6 minutes, until brown and then similarly on the other side for again; 5 - 6
            minutes. The total frying time for the dark meat should be 10 -12 minutes, while for the white meat it
            should be 14 - 15 minutes. You can take out everything at the end of 14 - 15 minutes, because you added the
            white meat first. So they ALL END UP COOKING TOGETHER.
            <br><br>4) After frying, ALLOW IT TO REST FOR 5 - 6 MINUTES. OMG I CANNOT STOP EMPHASIZING ON THIS. IF YOU
            RIP INTO THE PIPING HOT CHICKEN, IT WILL BLEED OUT ALL THE DELICIOUS JUICES, MAKING THE EXTERIOR
            SOGGY AND THE INTERIOR DRY; which is obviously what you don't want. (I shall judge you seriously
            if you like soggy, dry chicken.)
            <br>Once rested for 5 - 6 minutes, dig in!! (I won't judge you now ) :)
            <br>DO NOT REST IT FOR TOO LONG, BECAUSE NOBODY LIKES A COLD FRIED CHICKEN PIECE. But if you do,
            only prayers can save you my friend! Cheers :)
