                <b>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</b><br>
                <br><b>Media:</b><br>
                If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF
                GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the
                website.<br><br>

                <b>Cookies:</b><br>
                If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in
                cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you
                leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.
                <br><br>
                If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts
                cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.
                <br><br>
                When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen
                display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you
                select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login
                cookies will be removed.
                <br><br>
                If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie
                includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires
                after 1 day.<br><br>

                <b>Embedded content from other websites</b><br>
                Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded
                content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other
                website.
                <br><br>
                These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and
                monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the
                embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

                <b>Analytics</b><br><br>
                <b>Who we share your data with</b> <br><br>
                <b>How long we retain your data</b> <br>
                If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can
                recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation
                queue.
                <br><br>
                For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in
                their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except
                they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
                <br><br>
                <b>What rights you have over your data</b><br>
                If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file
                of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request
                that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep
                for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
                <br><br>
                <b>Where we send your data</b><br>
                Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.
